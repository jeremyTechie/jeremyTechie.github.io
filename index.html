        <p class="subheading" id="paragraph-1">"By the 1760s, more than 150 years after the first English settlement in North America was established, the American colonies were thriving. The British parliament elected to pass a series of acts between 1760 and 1775 that would create and/or increase taxes on goods, commerce, and trade in the colonies.</p>

<p class="subheading" id="paragraph-2">Much of this tax would be used to pay for the British debt after the long and costly French and Indian War. The American colonists felt this was unfair because they were not able to vote in parliamentary elections and therefore had no voice in the matter. This led to the famous motto 'No taxation without representation'." -<span id="source"><a href="https://www.studentsofhistory.com/stamp-sugar-intolerable-acts#:~:text=The%20Stamp%20Act%2C%20Sugar%20Act,led%20to%20The%20American%20Revolution.">Students of History</a></span></p></div>
        
        
        
    <!--The actual timeline-->
    <!--1763 Proclamation Line-->
        <h1 id="proc-line" class="year">Procolamation Line of 1763</h1>
        <p class="t1763">After winning the French and Indian War, the colonists were excited of new opportunities that would be opened up for them since they were being surrounded and restricted by the French. The western frontier had now been open to them after it was surrendered to the British by the French. The Proclamation Line of 1763 prevented the colonists from taking over this territory. The King and his council argued that it was made to prevent the Indians from fearing that they may be kicked out of their land if the colonists were to expand west.</p>
        <p class="t1763">The Thirteen Colonists saw this line in another light: they were being restricted to staying along the Atlantic seaboard as to be easier to be controlled. They felt even more emotional (resentment) about it due to the fact that they perceived this territory as a well-deserved prize, and they just got that taken away from them. The relationship between Indians and the English settlers was so bad that there were very few colonists that agreed with this line. To add salt to the wound, the colonists were taxed in order to pay for the outposts dividing the Thirteen Colonies from the Indian territory because the British ministry "argued that these outposts were for colonial defense, and as such should be paid for by the colonies."</p>

    <!--1765 Stamp Act-->
    <h1 id="stamp-act">Stamp Act of 1765</h1>
    <p class="t1765">Was held to pay for the British troops colonies that were in Seven year war during the time via taxes since Great Britain was in debt of over 72 million pounds. Stamped items had a tax on them, and these taxes would pay for the expenses of, for example, defense from the Seven Years War.</p>
    <p class="t1765">The colonist were angry at the fact that they had to pay tax and this lead to a rebellion against the British.</p>
